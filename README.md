# 📷 Photo Gallery - ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--progress-yellow)

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification**. It focuses on the power of **CSS Flexbox** to create a responsive, centered image gallery that adapts beautifully to different screen sizes.

## 🛠 Technologies
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure with a clear header and image container.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox (`flex-wrap`, `justify-content`), `object-fit` for image scaling, and pseudo-elements for layout alignment.

## 🚀 Features
* **Flexbox Grid:** Responsive layout that wraps images based on screen width.
* **Uniform Aspect Ratio:** Using `object-fit: cover` to maintain consistent image heights without distortion.
* **Modern UI:** Dark-themed header with gold accents and rounded gallery images.

## 🧠 The Process (freeCodeCamp Workshop)
1. **Layout Strategy:** Used Flexbox to create a flexible row that automatically wraps items.
2. **Visual Consistency:** Implemented `object-fit: cover` to ensure all images fill their containers uniformly.
3. **Alignment Trick:** Added a pseudo-element (`::after`) to the gallery to maintain consistent spacing even in the last row.
